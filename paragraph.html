    <p class="text-xl font-sans indent-2 text-red-300 hover:text-red-700">........You've always been a great friend(well till recently) even recently sef I can still say you're one of my best friends. Our friendship has never been straightfoward and it kinda hurt when u said you didn't expect me to do anything for your birthday. My head was like whattttt is that how hard our friendship has fallen. Skipping all the sad shi welllllll it's your birthday and I did these for you hope you like em. yk ppl pay programmers hundreds of thousands just 4 a simple website ur good friend here did it for free You're welcome!!!! You've grown so much that sometimes I really do not think I know who you are anymore then you just show up and be your fun and beautiful self. To be completely honest I really do not know much to write If I wanna rant here I'd just be talking lines and lines about us and whatever I am sure u don't want me to do that so lemme just feed your ego for you small</p>

    <div class="bg-red-300 px-20 py-10 rounded-full border-2 border-solid border-red-700 shadow-xl shadow-purple-100 hover:text-purple-700 hover:text-wrap">
    <p class="text-xl font-serif mt-4 text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-700">You are a really beautiful and caring person. I can't say amazing friend cause well idkkkk. You illuminate wherever you go so much that when you aren't there it feels like you were actually the only source of light. Your smile heals the heart and makes others around you want to smile(maybe you should branch into psychology just to smile to depressed ppl cause I'm sure your smile would make them feel better). You are way smarter than you give yourself credit for. I keep saying you're one of the smartest ppl I know and I mean it every single time you just do not believe it. Not many ppl can resume school as late as you did and still cope just fine yk. You'd make an amazing doctor one day for sure. Do not let anyone sleep on you as you have the brain and mentality to become anything you wanna buh u just happen to choose medicine. Your laugh is contagious and can bring light to even the darkest of minds.   </p>
